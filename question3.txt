QUESTION #3
===========

This is a trick question, but there is a correct answer.  The intended
audience of the question is actually kindergartners.

Complete the sequence...

0091 = 3
0113 = 1
9999 = 4
8600 = 5
6712 = 1
1115 = 0
8811 = 4
4334 = 0
1001 = 2

6811 = 3

Solution: each number maps to the total number of "loops" in its digits. So it's the sum of mapping each digit thus:
0 = 1
1 = 0
2 = 0
3 = 0
4 = 0
5 = 0
6 = 1
7 = 0
8 = 2
